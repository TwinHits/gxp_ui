# Guild eXPerience UI

Deployment is managed by AWS CDK v2.

## Project setup
This project requires node v16.13.2.

2. `npm install`
3. Copy `config.json_example`, rename to `config.json`, and replace `REPLACE_ME` values.

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run format
```

### Deploy to AWS using AWS CDK
Mine is currently set up to work in WSL.

### Troubleshooting
Command '['/opt/awscli/aws', 's3', 'cp', 's3://xxxx.zip', '/tmp/xxxx/xxxxx']' died with <Signals.SIGKILL: 9>.
The CDK autogenerated Lambda function is failing, probably due to memory constraints.
